m, n = map(int, input().split())

a = [['.']*m for i in range(n)]

for i in range(n):
  for j in range(m):
    if (i+j)%2 != 0:
      a[i][j] = '*'
for row in a:
  print (*row)


  Model Solution

  n, m = [int(s) for s in input().split()]
a = [['.' if (i + j) % 2 == 0 else '*']
     for i in range(n)
     for j in range(m)]
for line in a:
  print(*line)
